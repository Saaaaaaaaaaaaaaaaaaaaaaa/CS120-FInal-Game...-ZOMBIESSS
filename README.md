# CS120-FInal-Game...-ZOMBIESSS
Going into the semester i knew nothing about how to make a game except that it took coding. 
Now that the semester is over, my goal for the project was to make a fully working game with sound, graphics and a system that doesnt break.
In this Zombie Survive game, it will just be you and an infinite amount of zombies coming towards you
in order to survive you will have to move around using ARROW KEYS and shoot them using SPACE.
Its a simple "who can get the highest score in under 30 seconds" kind of game.
It uses a for loop to keep the zombies regenerating and multiple sprites, one for each component that moves (Zombies, The Player, The BackGround, Bullets)
The graphics are all made in PixelArt
I learned alot going into this project. I can look at a line of gaming code and understand what is supposed to be done and what its for
how sprites are used and that theres alot of uploading a file into anoter file so that another file could run the right- you get the picture.
It seemed as if i could understand it and know what i need to do, but it always came to knowing how to do it. 
For example the Zombies were working until i added an if statement to the sprite for when it comes in contact with bullets
it took me a while to understand what the problem was until i noticed it was a problem in SimpleGE. i ended up fixing it but i feel that because im 
so new to this, its hard to be just good at it, it takes practice but i dont have the creative mind to just sit down and make a random game.
So i would like to improve my knowledge. im always going to be behind, but in order for me to actually understand whatt im doing, i need hands on expeerience
and then when i get it wrong someone will show me the correct way, I NEED TO GET IT WRONG MYSELF
with all that being said, the only thing that stayed the same in this game was the Zombie idea.
i originally wanted the zombies to come in from all angles, but i never asked for help because i would wake up late and miss class and couldnt find help online
i tried adding sound for when the zombies get hit, and it will work but only for like 5 seconds
other than those two things though its a decent game and because it impressed my friends and family i decided to keep working on it, im for sure gonna keep trying though.
